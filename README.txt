Kubernetes Lesson

During my IT Web Programming diploma, we had a course called Special Topics. In this course students independently research a topic and then teach a class about it (usually for about an hour). After the class you assign a "challenge" that students must complete before the next class.

For my topic I chose K8s. These days containerization is everywhere and orchestration is a big part of that. I believe having a basic understanding of what that means is important. This lesson was a very, very basic overview and I supplied as many resources and learning aids as possible to assist students, without going too far down the rabbit hole.

*The first cluster diagram png was created by me. The other two are from the K8s Documentation. Also, shout out to the Udemy course by Stephen Grider, which explains Docker+K8s excellently.
